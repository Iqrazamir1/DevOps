LAMP Stack

LAMP Stack is a popular and widely-used set of open-source software that forms the foundation for developing 
and running dynamic websites and web applications.

Linux: 
    The operating system that servers as the foundation of the stack. It provides the core infrastructure to 
    run the web server, database, and other applications.

Apache: 
    The web server software responsible for serving web pages to browsers that request them. Apache processes 
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request and delivers the request content to the users.

MySQL: 
    The relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and mange the websites data, it allows
    developers to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.


PHP: 
    The server-side scripting language that is used to create dynamic content and interact with the database. 
    PHP is responsible for processing data from the database, generating HTML, and communicating with the web
    server.


Example of using LAMP Stack - Creating a basic website  

Linux: 
    Choose a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian) to sever as the operating system on your server.

Apache: 
    Install the Apache web server on the Linux system. Apache would listen for incoming HTTP requests from 
    visitors browsers and serve the appropriate web pages in response.

MySQL: 
    Set up MySQL database to store blog posts, user information, and other relevant data. This is where the 
    website's content and data would be sorted.

PHP: 
    You would use PHP to create the dynamic parts of the website. For example: You'd use PHP to fetch blog 
    posts from the database and display them on the blog's homepage, handle user registration and login, and 
    process from submissions. With the LAMP Stack in place, visitors to your blog website could access the 
    content hosted on your server, and the website would be able to interact with the database to retrieve 
    and display data dynamically.
