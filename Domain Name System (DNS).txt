Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS is essentially the phonebook of the internet. When you type a website address 
(like www.example.com) into your web browser, your computer uses DNS to translate that 
human-readable domain name into an IP address (like 192.0.2.1), which is the numerical 
address that computers use to identify each other on the internet.

DNS Query Types:

A Query: 
    This type of query is used to retrieve the IPv4 address associated with a domain name. 
    It's the most common type of DNS request and is used for resolving domain names to their 
    corresponding IPv4 addresses.

AAAA Query: 
    DNS AAAA records match a domain name to an IPv6 address. DNS AAAA records are exactly 
    like DNS A records, except that they store a domain's IPv6 address instead of its IPv4 
    address.

CNAME Query: 
    Used to retrieve the canonical name (CNAME) records for a domain. These records 
    alias one domain name to another, allowing for easier domain management and redirection.

MX Query: 
    Used to retrieve the mail exchange (MX) records for a domain. These records specify the 
    mail servers responsible for receiving email on behalf of the domain.

NSlookup

NSlookup is a command-line tool used to perform queries on domain name servers.

    nslookup www.pluralsight.com

Use the -query option to request only an 'A' record:

    nslookup -query=A www.pluralsight.com

Use the -debug option to display the full response information:

    nslookup -debug www.pluralsight.com

    Note: This provides a more detailed response, including the Time-to-Live (TTL) values and 
            any additional record information that is returned.
